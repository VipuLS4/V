# Help and Support
I'm exploring licensing options for the FIRST time and would love to connect with someone who has expertise in this area. I'm seeking advice on how to proceed in a way that allows the project to remain open-source while also providing a path to monetization. My goal is to ensure the projectâ€™s financial sustainability so I can dedicate more time to its development and eventually build a team around it.
