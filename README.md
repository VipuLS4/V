Welcome to Extension | OS

# Why

It all started on the morning of July 27th, 2024, when I decided to participate in the SF Hackathon x Build Club.

# Vision & Mission

Imagine a world where every user has access to powerful large language models (LLMs) directly within their web browser. By integrating LLMs into everyday internet browsing, we can revolutionise the way people interact with information online, providing them with instant, intelligent assistance tailored to their needs.

## Awareness

All your data is stored locally on your hard drive.

### MAC OSX

`/Users/<your-username>/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Sync Extension Settings/`

## To-Do List

### Urgent & Important

-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the ability to edit a single prompt.
-  **Logging**: Determine a location to store log files.
-  **MoA**: Implement this feature.

### Urgent, Not Important

-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the ability to create custom prompts.
-  Add the ability to chat within the browser.
-  Encryption of keys : They are stored locally, nonetheless being my first chrome extension i need to research more about how this can be accessed.

### Important, Not Urgent

-  Move files to a `/src` folder to improve organization.
-  Strategically organize the codebase structure.
-  Perfect the README documentation.
-  Evaluate the necessity of `executeScript`.
-  Decide on a package manager: npm, pnpm, or yarn.
-  Investigate if Playwright supports Chrome extension testing.

### Not Urgent, Not Important

-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the ability to build workflows.
-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the option to select which LLM to use for each prompt.
