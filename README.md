## Why

On the morning of July 27th, 2024, I began an exciting journey by joining the SF Hackathon x Build Club. After months of refining the concept in my mind, I decided it was time to bring it to life. I worked on enhancing my idea, updating what I had already created, and empowering everyone to unleash their creativity with custom prompts.

### Data - Awareness

All your data is stored locally on your hard drive.
