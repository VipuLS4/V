## Why

On the morning of July 27th, 2024, I began an exciting journey by joining the SF Hackathon x Build Club. After months of refining the concept in my mind, I decided it was time to bring it to life. I worked on enhancing my idea, updating what I had already created, and empowering everyone to unleash their creativity with custom prompts.

### Data - Awareness

All your data is stored locally on your hard drive.

#### MAC OSX

`/Users/<your-username>/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Sync Extension Settings/`

## To-Do List

### Urgent & Important

-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the ability to edit a single prompt.
-  **Logging**: Determine a location to store log files.
-  **MoA**: Implement this feature.

### Urgent, Not Important

-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the ability to create custom prompts.
-  Add the ability to chat within the browser.
-  Encryption of keys : They are stored locally, nonetheless being my first chrome extension i need to research more about how this can be accessed.

### Important, Not Urgent

-  UI for the Prompt Factory is not intuitive and the "save all" button UX is cr@p.
-  The sidebar API doesn't work after the storage API is called (User Interaction must be done)
-  Move files to a `/src` folder to improve organization.
-  Strategically organize the codebase structure.
-  Perfect the README documentation.
-  Evaluate the necessity of `executeScript`.
-  Decide on a package manager: npm, pnpm, or yarn.
-  Investigate if Playwright supports Chrome extension testing.

### Not Urgent, Not Important

-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the ability to build workflows.
-  **Prompt Factory**: Add the option to select which LLM to use for each prompt.
